The generic data structure library is a bunch of data structures that are designed and created in as generic a fashion as possible. Each data structure will contain its own basic memory management, be able to handle any object type, and hopefully constraint to strict algorithmic constraints. When the library hits version 1.0, it will contain the following data structures:


  * Doubly Linked List - Done
  * List-based Queue - Done
  * List-based Deque - Done
  * List-based Stack - Done
  * Vector - Done
  * Vector-based Queue - Done
  * Vector-based Deque - Done
  * Vector-based Stack -Done
  * Binary Tree - Done
  * Hash Table - Done
  * Priority Queue - Done
  * Heap - Done
  * Memory Manager
  * Object Cache w/ Garbage Collection
  * AB Tree
  * Split Lists
  * RB Tree
  * AVL Tree
